This dataset is from the Department of Veteran Affairs that include studies related to PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). The data stems from various research publications differentiated by unique study IDs.

The data was collected from published studies on PTSD treatments. This involves systematic literature review processes, where researchers identify, select, and aggregate data from relevant research studies or clinical trials that meet predefined inclusion criteria.

Data extraction might have been done manually by researchers reading through each study and recording relevant information, or through automated means using text mining and data extraction tools that can process research articles to extract predefined data points.

What program was used to clean the data?​
Without specific documentation, it's unclear which program was used. Data cleaning can be done using various software tools or programming languages that are commonly used in data science, such as Python (with libraries like pandas), R, or specialized data cleaning tools like OpenRefine.

How was the data cleaned or transformed? Be specific.​
Removing duplicate entries or studies.
Standardizing the format of study IDs, publication years, and other categorical or textual data.
Handling missing values, either by imputation (filling in missing data based on certain rules or statistical methods) or by removing entries with significant missing information.
Normalizing geographic points to a standard format (e.g., converting all geographic locations to a consistent coordinate system).
Converting text-based descriptions of numeric data into structured numeric formats (e.g., extracting numeric values from the "N Randomized Detail" text).

What are the units of the numeric data?​
The units for numeric data depend on the context of each variable:
N Randomized: The count of participants (unitless, simply a count).
PTSD Criteria Met at Baseline Percent: Percentage (a proportion from 0 to 1, often displayed as a percentage).
PTSD Severity at Baseline Mean: Likely based on the scale used for measurement (e.g., scores from PTSD assessment tools like CAPS-5, PCL-C, which have their own scoring systems).


What were the formulas used in column creation?​
Mean scores might be calculated using the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores.
Percentages (e.g., for criteria met at baseline) could be calculated by dividing the number of participants meeting certain criteria by the total number of participants and multiplying by 100

How is the data validated to ensure consistency?​
Range checks for numeric values to ensure they fall within expected limits.
Consistency checks across related data fields (e.g., ensuring the number randomized matches the sum of participants in different treatment arms).
Cross-validation with source material to ensure extracted data matches the original publications.

What are the definitions for the column names? Include all columns in your dataset.​
Study ID: A unique identifier for each study.
Study_Publication_Year: The year the study was published.
Study Class: The type of study (e.g., pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy).
N Randomized: Number of participants randomized in the study.
PTSD Severity at Baseline Mean: The average severity score of PTSD symptoms among participants at the start of the study.


If there are set variable options in your dataset, what are thier definitions? ​
Set variable options might include categorical data like Study Class or Risk of Bias Rating, with predefined options such as:

Study Class: Could include categories like Pharmacotherapy, Psychotherapy, indicating the type of treatment studied.
Risk of Bias Rating: Levels might include "Low," "Some Concerns," "High," indicating the assessed risk of bias in the study's findings.


What are the regulations to using the data?
Confidentiality: Ensuring participant anonymity and compliance with data protection laws.
Use Limitations: Data might be restricted to academic or non-commercial use, requiring permission for other uses.
Citation Requirements: Users might be required to cite the source of the data in any publications or presentations.
